The output indicates discrepancies in the expected accuracy percentages compared to the actual results produced by the application.\n\n**Context:**\nThe issue arises when users attempt to evaluate their typing performance through the application. The accuracy metrics are crucial for providing feedback to users on their typing skills. This functionality is essential for users who rely on accurate statistics to track their progress and improve their typing abilities.\n\n**Expected vs Actual Behavior:**\n- **Expected Behavior:** The application should accurately calculate and display the typing accuracy percentage based on the user's input during typing tests. For example, if a user types 90 out of 100 characters correctly, the expected accuracy should be reported as 90%.\n  \n- **Actual Behavior:** The application is reporting incorrect accuracy percentages. For instance, in the test cases, a user who typed 90 out of 100 characters correctly is being shown an accuracy of 85%. This discrepancy leads to confusion and undermines the reliability of the typing metrics provided to users.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThis issue has been observed across multiple test cases, indicating a potential systemic problem in the accuracy calculation logic.
